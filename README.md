A web-based linguistic analysis tool utilizing WordNet and n-grams to study word usage over time, featuring interactive visualizations and API services for dynamic data processing.

#### Project Overview
This project, **Ngordnet**, is an advanced linguistic tool designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of language usage patterns through historical data.

#### Data Handling
- **WordNet Integration**: Utilizes the WordNet database, which provides a rich lexical network of English words. This is essential for tasks like semantic analysis, synonym generation, and relationship mapping between words.
- **n-grams Analysis**: Implements functionality to process and analyze n-grams data, which helps in understanding the frequency and context of word usage over extensive time periods. This can be particularly useful for studying linguistic evolution and predicting language trends.

- **Modular Design**: The application is structured into multiple directories and modules:
  - **data**: Manages datasets, potentially including large-scale text corpora and structured WordNet data.
  - **ngordnet**: Contains several sub-modules tailored to specific aspects of the application:
    - **hugbrowsermagic**: A module for managing web interactions through the Hug API framework, facilitating backend-to-frontend communications.
    - **ngrams**: Dedicated to the processing and statistical analysis of n-grams data.
    - **plotting**: Focuses on generating visual data representations, using libraries such as Matplotlib or Bokeh.
    - **main**: Hosts the main executable scripts and core application logic, orchestrating the workflow between data processing and user interactions.
  - **static**: Houses static files necessary for the web front-end, such as HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity to web pages.

#### Web Interface
- **Interactive User Interface**: The HTML and JavaScript files suggest a dynamic web interface that allows users to input data, request analyses, and view results in real time. The presence of `ngordnet.html` and `ngordnet_2a.html` indicates multiple views or stages of interaction, possibly catering to different user needs or offering varied levels of analysis depth.
- **Visualizations**: The project likely features advanced graphical representations of data, enabling users to visualize trends and patterns in word usage effectively. These could include line graphs, bar charts, or heatmaps.

- **API Design**: Uses the Hug framework to create lightweight, maintainable, and scalable API services that facilitate the communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Error Handling and Security**: Ensures robust error handling mechanisms to manage data integrity and security, critical when dealing with large datasets and user interactions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements efficient data processing algorithms and optimizes web assets (like minified JavaScript) to enhance performance and user experience.
